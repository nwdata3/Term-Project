# Term-Project
# Introduction
I’m conducting this research as the fund manager of an investment fund focused on energy, biosciences, and cryptocurrency securities. I plan to use technical analysis methods to guide buy and sell decisions, particularly in response to market volatility. My goal is to provide actionable insights for individuals with traditional finance backgrounds who are interested in learning how data science-driven, technically focused strategies can be applied to today’s markets. I’m also working to build a forward-looking portfolio centered around emerging technologies that support the future of industry, human advancement, and digital assets. I believe these sectors will be pivotal to the long-term health of our environment and the evolution of the human species.

# Literature Review 

Several foundational and contemporary authors have contributed significantly to the field of technical analysis. These include Robert Edwards & John Magee, W.H.C. Bassetti, Thomas Meyers, Barbara Rockefeller, and Trivedi & Kyal.
All authors and researchers provide unique perspectives and recommendations:
Edwards & Magee develops the groundwork for pattern recognition and Dow Theory.
Meyers focuses on technical indicators and step-by-step analysis methods.
Barbara Rockefeller provides a modern, risk-conscious approach focused on entry/exit planning and accessibility.
Trivedi & Kyal blends traditional techniques with algorithmic trading and intermarket analysis.
A common theme across these works is the importance of diversification across sectors and asset classes, which is a consistent concept with financial theory taught in academia. Each research provides both practical tools and theoretical backing for my strategy.

# Methods
This research is based on technical analysis and emphasizes diversification across ETFs, individual stocks, and sector-based funds.
Portfolio Structure Plan:
1. I’ll begin by screening ETFs within each target sector (energy, biosciences, manufacturing, and crypto) using historical price data, trend strength, and technical patterns.
2. I will then identify high-potential individual stocks through platforms like Stocktwits, MarketBeat, and trend analysis dashboards.
3. Given that this approach is driven by technicals rather than fundamentals, my focus will be on chart patterns, volume trends, moving averages, and support/resistance levels.

A key challenge is the risk of misinterpretation due to market manipulation (e.g., short squeezes, insider activity). However, these same distortions can also highlight market inefficiencies, creating opportunities for short-term gains that may not be apparent through fundamental analysis.

# Results

What I’ve discovered so far from my research is the following: 
1. Bioscience companies often trade based on clinical trial milestones and FDA approval stages, leading to extreme volatility. This factor will be critical in deciding which individual stocks to include.
2. Cryptocurrency is now a relevant and legitimate part of a diversified portfolio. Its performance is increasingly decorrelated from traditional equity markets, making it useful for hedging and alternative exposure.

My plan is for high-growth potential with some risk management across my portfolio given having a more risk-averse mentality.

# Conclusion
Overall, I feel comfortable with my sectors that I picked and my overall diversification high-level strategy. Based on what historical research has suggested, not concentrating on one sector and apply it across crypto, equities, and forex and timeframes should also be considered.
